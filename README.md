# GreenLeadsApp
User Story:

Right now I'm apart of a team at XYZ Compnay, called the Green Leads Team. This team is specifically cold calling non-XYZ Company Customers. So this team searches right now using the current work flow. Example time, it takes about 1hr+ to generate 20 leads. The minimum requirement is for each team member to have 200+ leads per month. The top producer right now is averaging 1,200 leads per month. Time and efficiency are the huge bonuses. 

Current workflow:

Yelp/Google>Select City/State> Select industry from verticals> (get most profitable GL sourced from Data Team)

[Activities and Events, Arts, Automotive, Financial Services, Fishing Charters, Health & Wellness, Hotel, Local Services, Nightlife, Inspectors, Other, Pets, Professional Services, Realtor, Restaurant, Retail, Roofers, Plumbers, Spa & Salon, Travel, Hot & New]

(Current next step is to use our XYZ Self Sourcing Tool to see if itâ€™s Green/Red, Green is not in GD Salesforce, Red means it is in our database. Need to work on getting access to that data. Our might bypass that step and check URL)

U/I 
The user will first get prompted to a HTML page that says Request Access. That would send a notification to me to register the approved accessor. Must use their XYZ Company email address. Then a password would get generated. 

There will be a second button below for log in for returning users. XYZ email and password required. 

Once they are in the app there will be search fields:

City, State and Vertical. Vertical can have a drop down box with all options.  

Then the data would come back as results and store the data future use. Create a storage database so the user can come back to it.
